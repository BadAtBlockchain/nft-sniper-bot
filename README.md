Just a bit of fun. Tried to learn how to bot and effectively snipe NFT's that were put up for sale on NFTKey for a price below a certain threshold. 

Nothing ground breaking, nothing like MEV. Hasn't been used for a long time, I think I ran it for a day or two to see the results. I was more happy with the knowledge I learnt along the way.
